# FDM-flexdrone-project
A project worked on while working at FDM. This project uses 
Flask (with css and java script) for webdevelopment, 
Python3 
and SQLite3 for data storage. 

Our team worked in combination with a business team that supplied the project deliverables. 
We also worked using a agile framework.
